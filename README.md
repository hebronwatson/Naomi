# naomi
It is said that in DevOps, virtual machines (including here for all intents, docker containers, etc.) should be cattle, not pets. That being said, how can one raise a thousand cattle, if they cannot take care of one pet?

### The Naomi Project is the first in a line of VMs raised like cattle (in terms of automation and immutability), but treated as pets, because they are build environments. 
Thus, they get their own projects and may even get to live beyond their usefulness to me, for documentation purposes. The aim is not to take on the unhealthy practice of doing things manually. Naomi and Ruth are being designed to stand up for their host applications using only <code>vagrant up</code>. Any aberation from this methodology should be flagged.

## Update!
I have been having issues with my favoured linux distro family, RHEL. I have not been able to find a vagrant box that has reliable shared folders, and so I have moved the project that I initially created Naomi to serve - Hoopscore - to an ubuntu box, which has flourished sinced its inception and is named Ruth. Fear not! Because these are pets, I won't give up on Naomi so quickly, but time-contraints demand that she be put aside momentarily.

### Updates coming soon.
